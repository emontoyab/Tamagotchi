# Tamagotchi 🈹💥
## By: Esteban Montoya 🦊

Here you will find a simple Tamagotchi game as an excercise of HTML, CSS and JS.

The scope of this game is to keep your pet alive 🙀. For this 1st release, you can only find one pet and make 3 actions like playing 🙉, sleeping 😴 and eating 🍕.

* By pressing each button you will supply the needs 🌭💩 of your pet and increase the values on the top scores. 

* There are some restrictions, like if your pet is tired 🥱, it can not play.

* If one of the basic needs is too low, your pet will tell you by using a red message 🚩.

* Note the cool skills your pet is provided with, like playing as crazy, sleeping with the lights off and snoring loudly or eating a thousand of burgers per second 🤯🤪😵.

* For this first release, your pet will not die 💀, but in the future I plan to kill it if you don't take enough care of it 😈👺. So make advantage on this and try these nice features.

I deeply hope you enjoy it as I did it by creating this game. This is just for fun and learning! ✨🎉🎊🎈

Have a nice game! 🧡🕹🎮🏆
